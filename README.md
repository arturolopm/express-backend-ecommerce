# E-commerce Back-end using Express and MongoDB
This is the back-end repository for an e-commerce project built with Express and MongoDB. The project uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and communicates with the front-end through REST APIs. It also uses JWT for authentication.

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/arturolopm/express-backend-ecommerce.git

Note: for testing purposes, I have provided testing keys in the .env file on purpose so if you don't want or donÂ´t need to understand Paypal and MongoDB you can run the project. However, I strongly recommend that you replace them with your own keys if you want to use this project in production.
